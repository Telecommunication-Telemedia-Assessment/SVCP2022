### Joint Research Incubator Award
Up to two awards will be given, each one comes with a certificate and a prize money of 1.000 Euro. 

Due to a generous sponsorship we have the possibility to offer Joint Research Incubator Awards for SVCP participants. 
For this you need to team up with a SVCP colleague from an institution other than your own and develop a new idea or technology in the area of video compression and processing.

Prepare a research paper with your colleague(s) about the outcome of your joint research and submit it to a conference or journal. 
If this paper gets accepted for a conference or preliminarily accepted subject to a revision for a journal by the date of the next SVCP in July 2023, you may apply for the award.

For application please send your paper including acceptance notice to <a href="mailto:andre.kaup@fau.de" target="_blank">Prof. André Kaup</a>, spokesperson of the ITG Technical Committee MT 2, before next SVCP in July 2023. 
Decision for the award is based on novelty, clarity, and team involvement and will be taken by the ITG Technical Committee MT 2.
