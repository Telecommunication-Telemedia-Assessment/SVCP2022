### The TU Ilmenau

It was founded in 1894 as a private educational institution named Thüringisches Technikum Ilmenau, later Engineering School. 
After communization in 1947, it was converted into a technical college for electrical engineering and mechanical engineering in 1950 and finally into a technical university in 1992.

### The City of Ilmenau
A nursery rhyme describes the city that way:
"In Ilmenau, da ist der Himmel blau,
da tanzt der Ziegenbock mit seiner Frau."

"In Ilmenau, the sky is blue,
the billy goat dances with his wife"

Probably this is supposed to indicate a föhn-like weather phenomenon, which makes the sky above Ilmenau appear remarkably often blue. 
But find out for yourself here :-)

The Goethe and university town, formerly a mountain and bathing town, is famous for its charming scenic location on the northern edge of the Thuringian Forest in the upper Ilm valley.
The town lies between 475 and 580 m above sea level in the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Thuringian Forest and Thuringian Basin. 
The highest peak is the local mountain Kickelhahn with 861 m.
