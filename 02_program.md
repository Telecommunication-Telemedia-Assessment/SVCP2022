## Keynote/Invited Lecture

**Speaker:** Christian Feldmann

**Title:** Video Coding in the Cloud – Challenges and Solutions

**Abstract:** After the rise of video streaming over the internet (OTT) more and more workflows for video transcoding and distribution are moving to the cloud. While this combination can be a match made in heaven, it is full of challenges like a multitude of different video and codecs, streaming container formats, subtitle formats, etc. The talk will give an overview of the transcoding landscape and the biggest challenges that we and our customers are facing. We will talk about codecs and device compatibility, cloud infrastructure, encoders and how some of the biggest names in streaming are trying to solve these problems.

<!--
* lab tours (AVLabs, hearing lab, medialab II)
* maybe hiking to a restaurant?

* Lab-Tours & Get-Together: On Sunday, 25 July, there was a Get-Together, including technical tours at the 3IT, CINIQ as well as in the TiME-Lab where participants learned more about the work of the Fraunhofer HHI and its partners.

* Spree Boat Tour: Participants of the Summer School were taken on an evening boat tour on the river Spree in Berlin, where they were treated to a delicious barbecue. The relaxed atmosphere gave them the chance to further exchange ideas after a day of fruitful discussions and to get to know each other even more, while enjoying a beautiful trip through the center of the city.
