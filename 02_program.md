* Lab-Tours & Get-Together: On Sunday, 25 July, there was a Get-Together, including technical tours at the 3IT, CINIQ as well as in the TiME-Lab where participants learned more about the work of the Fraunhofer HHI and its partners.

* Spree Boat Tour: Participants of the Summer School were taken on an evening boat tour on the river Spree in Berlin, where they were treated to a delicious barbecue. The relaxed atmosphere gave them the chance to further exchange ideas after a day of fruitful discussions and to get to know each other even more, while enjoying a beautiful trip through the center of the city.
