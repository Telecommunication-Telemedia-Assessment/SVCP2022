    <td class="tg-zv4m"><b>Abstract:</b> After the rise of video streaming over the internet (OTT) more and more workflows for video transcoding and distribution are moving to the cloud. While this combination can be a match made in heaven, it is full of challenges like a multitude of different video and codecs, streaming container formats, subtitle formats, etc. The talk will give an overview of the transcoding landscape and the biggest challenges that we and our customers are facing. We will talk about codecs and device compatibility, cloud infrastructure, encoders and how some of the biggest names in streaming are trying to solve these problems.</td>

## Demos 

### Hearing in Mixed Reality
A current trend in research and development is the extension of reality by adding artificial, virtual objects to realize mixed reality and augmented reality. The lab tour deals with methods and possibilities of measurement and auralization for the creation of virtual audio objects in the real listening environment. An audio system is presented in a practical way, in which all essential components for audio augmented reality are included, from recording to signal analysis and signal processing to playback. In addition to the headphone-based dynamic binaural audio reproduction, an (ambisonic-based) 22.2 loudspeaker reproduction will be presented, which gives an insight into the current loudspeaker-based sound reproduction of e.g. cinemas.
### IVE for educational research
The Immersive Virtual Environments (IVE) presented in this demo are developed at TU Ilmenau to investigate the suitability of audio-visual IVEs for a "real-world" assessment of the influence of the visuospatial and acoustic environment on cognitive performance of adults and children in classroom-type environments. There are two different visual representations: 360° video and a CGI model, while we will compare both visualizations with regard to the influence on quality, listening effort in noise and role of spatial audio for different paradigms. The demo is part of a DFG-funded project within the SPP 2236 AUDICTIVE.
### Co-Presence for Seniors
An overview of the goals of the CO-HUMANICS project funded by the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung (www.co-humanics.de) and its current research stage will be given, focusing on the factors impacting QoE in AR/MR and robot-based telepresence.
### Immersive Audiovisual Communication - Meeting in VR
IVEs promise to be an ideal medium for performing and studying group communication in a variety of situations. In an ongoing DFG project (as part of SPP 2236 AUDICTIVE), we aim to identify and gain a robust understanding of factors influencing plausibility and experience in multi-party audiovisual communication and interactive shared virtual environments. In this context, we assess plausibility, presence, quality as well as Quality of Experience (QoE) and develop methods for evaluation of such immersive systems. This demo shows a VR communication system that represents the basis for user studies conducted in our audiovisual test labs.
### Mobile Groovability: How well does your phone groove?
In an industry-funded project from 2019 - 2021, we investigated the impact of smartphone acoustic reproduction on the perceived groove of music. Groove in this context is the human experience that motivates dance movements such as rhythmic nodding or foot tapping.
In the present test, 8 different smartphones can be directly compared with each other based on various pieces of music.
### HD studio direction in action
We are happy to show our fully functional HD studio suitable for offline and live production. 
### Student film productions
We encourage students to produce short films, movies, music videos, and audio productions in our labs. With regard to audio, voice-overs can be recorded and media productions can be edited. Some students projects are shown. 
### 4K HDR Reference Screen
A professional reference monitor offers 4K HDR image quality, accuracy and consistency, making it perfect for demanding on-set, studio and post-production applications, including 4K digital film production. The capabilities are demonstrated with a few test sequences.
